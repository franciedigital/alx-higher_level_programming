Inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class, called the base class or superclass. The new class is called a derived class or subclass. This allows for code reuse and modularity in software design, as well as promoting a clear and organized structure. When a subclass inherits from a base class, it automatically has access to all of the attributes and methods of the base class, but can also add new attributes and override methods.
