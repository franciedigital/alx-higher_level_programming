# Python-Object-Relational-Mapping(ORM)
Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used to interact with relational databases using Python objects. It allows developers to write Python code to perform database operations, rather than writing SQL statements directly.

ORM frameworks like SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, and Peewee provide a high-level interface to interact with databases using Python classes, methods, and objects.

With an ORM, you can define classes that map to database tables, and instances of those classes represent rows in the tables. You can use methods on those instances to perform operations like inserting, updating, and deleting rows, or querying the database for data.
