SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage relational databases. It was first developed in the 1970s and has since become the standard language used to interact with and manipulate data in relational databases.

SQL allows users to create, modify, and delete database structures, as well as insert, update, and delete data in those structures. SQL also provides a variety of functions for retrieving and analyzing data, including filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating.

SQL is used by developers, data analysts, and database administrators to work with databases in a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and more. Because it is a standardized language, SQL can be used with many different relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, to name a few.

Some common SQL commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, and DROP. SQL can be used to perform complex queries and manipulate large amounts of data efficiently. It is a powerful tool for working with data and is essential for anyone working with relational databases.
