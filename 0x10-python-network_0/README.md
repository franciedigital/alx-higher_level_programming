# PYTHON NETWORK
Python provides several built-in libraries that allow you to work with network-related tasks. Here are some commonly used libraries for networking in Python:

 Socket: This library provides low-level access to the network interface for sending and receiving data over the network.

Requests: This library simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and working with APIs.

Scapy: This library allows you to create, send, and receive network packets.

Paramiko: This library provides a way to interact with remote servers over SSH.

Twisted: This library is an event-driven networking engine that allows you to build network applications such as servers and clients.

Flask: This library is a micro web framework that allows you to build web applications.

These libraries provide a wide range of functionality for working with networks in Python, including sending and receiving data, making requests, and building network applications.
