# URLLIB PACKAGE
The urllib package in Python is a module that provides a collection of modules for working with URLs. It is part of the standard library in Python, which means that it is available by default with any Python installation.

The urllib package consists of several modules, including:

 urllib.request: This module defines functions and classes for opening and working with URLs. It provides a high-level interface for fetching data from the web.

urllib.error: This module defines the exception classes raised by the urllib.request module.

urllib.parse: This module provides functions for parsing URLs and building URL strings. It also provides support for working with URL-encoded data.

urllib.robotparser: This module provides a parser for the robots.txt file used by web crawlers to determine which pages they are allowed to access.

The urllib.request module is probably the most commonly used module in the urllib package. It provides several functions for opening URLs, including:

urlopen(): Opens a URL and returns a file-like object that can be used to read its contents.

urlretrieve(): Downloads a URL to a local file.

urlcleanup(): Cleans up temporary files created by urlretrieve().

URLopener: A class that provides methods for opening URLs.

URLopener.open(): Opens a URL and returns a file-like object.

URLopener.retrieve(): Downloads a URL to a local file.

The urllib package is a powerful tool for working with URLs and fetching internet resources in Python. However, it is important to use it responsibly and to respect the terms of service of the websites you are accessing. Some websites may have limits on the amount of data you can fetch, or may prohibit automated access altogether.
